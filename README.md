# Welcome to ChatWave 🌊

ChatWave is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with TypeScript for the frontend, Socket.IO for real-time communication, JWT for authentication and authorization, bcrypt for password hashing, and Redux Toolkit (RTK) for state management.

## User Story 📜

👤 As a user, I want to seamlessly navigate through the ChatWave app to chat with friends and colleagues in real-time.

1. **Landing Page**: Upon visiting the website, users are greeted with a sleek login page, where they can log in or choose to create a new account.
2. **Registration**: Clicking on the "New User?" link directs users to the registration page. Here, users can securely create an account by providing their credentials.
3. **Login**: After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page. Here, they can effortlessly log in using their newly created credentials.
4. **Main Room**: Upon successful login, users are welcomed into the main chat room. Here, they can engage in real-time conversations with other users. They also have the option to join private rooms for more focused discussions.
5. **Private Rooms**: Users can seamlessly join private rooms to chat with specific individuals or groups. They have the flexibility to leave the room or log out directly from any chat interface.
